# dnstrace

A tool for visualizing the relationships between domain names using a web browser. As of right now, it is being submitted for peer review and a grade. However, I will continue development of this project and see it through to its next stages in complexity and awesomeness.

A project for CSEC 462 (Network Security and Forensics) at RIT in my junior year.

### Setup

See SETUP.md in the root of the repo for setup instructions.

However, it is inadvisable to set this up yourself, as it's a major resource-hog. I've made available a public instance of this at [dnstrace.pro](https://dnstrace.pro/) that will be continually updated with as much data as my systems can handle. If you need additional access to that system for more complex analysis, please shoot me a message or an email and I'll get you an API key ASAP.
